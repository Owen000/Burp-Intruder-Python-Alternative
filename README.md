# Burp-Intruder-Python-Alternative

This is a repo that contains Python scripts that are alternatives to Burp Intruder. This is necessary because there are some functions that it does not have and it is very throttled id you don't have the Pro version. The scripts are built to the test Portswiggers Web Academy Username Enumeration via Account Lock lab.
